    "The confusion matrix tells us that our classifier has an uneven amount of articles being labeled more than others. For example, we have 3 times as many articles about politics than we do about jobs but is more or less a similar amount compared to sports. However, we are not seeing as many articles mislabeled as sports compared to the 130 or so articles mislabeled as politics. Thus indicating that we should have different labels to classify our articles. Using more specific classifications would improve our results to avoid incorrect predictions as politics has a large variety of topics related to it."

       "\"Documents missing on chemicals in Gulf - report. The U.S. Defence Department said nearly all the classified documents recording incidents of chemical weapons use during the Gulf war are missing despite an exhaustive search, the New York Times reported on Friday. The paper said copies of the logs were kept in safes at two U.S. locations, but a new report from the Defence Department indicates only 36 pages out of an estimated 200 have been found in a search by its investigators. The missing logs include those for eight days in March 1991 when U.S. troops unknowingly blew up chemical weapons in an Iraqi arms dump, the paper said. Those logs, which were maintained for Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, were first reported missing in December. Friday's paper said the new report heightens speculation about a cover-up or criminal incompetence within the Defence Department, which had denied the existence of such records before agreeing last year to release them to a veterans' group. It said the logs were recorded on floppy disks and on paper and shipped to the headquarters of the United States Central Command in Tampa, Florida. A separate computer disk containing the information was stored at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, but nearly all the information at both sites has vanished, the Times said. The paper said the Defence Department gave its report to the Senate Armed Services Committee this month but had not yet planned to release it to the public.\""

China\\'s executive vice chairman of state planning Ye Qing on Friday said he expected the Chinese authorities soon to approve a major joint venture project to build a petrochemical plant with Shell in Guangdong province. \"I saw the managing director of Shell two days ago and I told him that I personally and the state commission will approve this project very soon,\" Ye told reporters in Paris at a press conference following an International Energy Agency ministerial meeting. The project to build a petrochemical plant is a joint venture with the state China National Offshore Oil Corporation and has been under discussion since 1971 Ye said the plants was expected to produce 85 million tonnes a year of ethylene, having been raised from previous plans for 45 million tonnes of annual capacity. Ye also said that plans for a refinery at the same site remained on hold. \"To ensure a better return for the project we have decided not to build a refinery at the same time but to import\" petroleum projects to supply the petrochemical complex, he said. The original project had been valued at $6 billion, including the originally-projected 160,000 barrels per day oil refinery. A spokesman for Shell in London declined to comment on Ye Qing\\'s statement.'"

       "'Australian Jews scan Swiss Holocaust bank list. Hundreds of relatives of Jewish Holocaust victims living in Australia could be eligible for funds in Swiss banks after the publication of more than 2,000 pre-1945 accounts, Jewish officials said on Wednesday. While only four Australian names were on the list, Australia boasts the world\\'s fourth largest Jewish population, due to large scale post-World War Two migration. \"There are more Jews of Polish decent living in Australia than there are Jews living in Poland,\" said Jeremy Jones, spokesman for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. \"There could potentially be hundreds (of relatives) on this list, but we do not believe that this list is comprehensive or exhaustive. This is the list from the Swiss banks: it is not a list discovered by any independent audit,\" Jones told Reuters. The Swiss Bankers Association took out a double-page advertisement in The Australian national newspaper, listing more than 2,000 pre-1945 accounts, including assets by Holocaust victims. The list included four Australian men. \"We imagine of the thousands of names many of those will not have any living relatives because of the extent of the Nazi genocide,\" Jones said. However, Jones said the publication of the list will make it easier for relatives of Holocaust victims to claim funds. Swiss bank sources on Tuesday said the total amount in dormant accounts was around US$40 million rather than US$29 million as the banks said last year. \"They are now saying we have this list and the issue is proving a relationship, which is easier,\" Jones said. \"We certainly hope this is an indication that the Swiss banks will no longer demand every receipt and deposit slip and every account number,\" he said. Jones said Australian Jews had mixed feelings about the publication of the list. \"We are happy, but why has it taken 52 years to happen. There has been a large level abrogation of morality,\" he said. On Saturday, a Sydney Jewish family said it had made a successful claim for funds belonging to a Holocaust victim held in a Swiss bank. The deal was done three weeks ago in Zurich between Sydney accountant Stephen Baruch and the Union Bank of Switzerland, Baruch told Reuters. The Australian newspaper reported Jewish community sources saying the amount, based on an original deposit of 600 pounds sterling in 1938, was now worth more than US$154,000. Baruch said that was an exaggeration.'"

      "Divided Hong Kong families protest to be reunited. More than 100 members of Hong Kong families separated from their loved ones in China staged a noisy protest outside the legislature on Wednesday to demand their relatives be allowed to settle in the British colony. \"I want a home with my father and mother,\" read placards waved by children, some little older than toddlers, as lawmakers arrived for a debate on the highly-charged topic. The demonstrators urged deputies to support a motion urging the government to take over the job of vetting applications from mainlanders seeking to migrate to Hong Kong, giving priority to those applying on family reunion grounds. Hong Kong permits 150 mainland Chinese to migrate each day. The Chinese authorities decide who gets the \"one-way permit\" entitling them to enter the territory. Application times vary widely from several months to several years. Some families have been split for more than a decade. Critics say the system is open to corruption and some officials demand large sums from applicants to jump the queue. Human smugglers, known as snakeheads, generally charge HK$2,000-$3,000 (US$260-390) per person to spirit illegal immigrants to Hong Kong. Most travel by speedboat under cover of darkness. Those caught are repatriated. Early last week immigration officials, in an unusual use of force, plucked an eight-year-old girl and her mother, both illegal immigrants, from their Hong Kong home and deported them to China. \"After July 1 Hong Kong will be a Special Administrative Region of China. Hong Kong should have the right to vet those who are coming in,\" said Law Chi-kwong, the Democratic Party lawmaker who tabled the motion. Social workers estimate that there are 30,000 to 130,000 children born in China to a Hong Kong parent who will be eligible to migrate to Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to China on July 1. Hong Kong's post-colonial constitution entitles all China-born children to right of abode if one of his or her parents is a permanent Hong Kong resident. (US$1 = HK$7.75)\n",

      "Lake pessimistic on Northern Ireland talks. Peace talks in Northern Ireland seem unlikely to produce a ceasefire with the Irish Republican Army, U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake said on Sunday. \"The talks frankly are not going well,\" Lake said on NBC television's \"Meet the Press.\" He said even if the IRA agreed to a truce, \"there's always a danger that a ceasefire could again be broken.\" IRA guerrilla forces broke a 17-month ceasefire last February. The British and Irish governments insist on a new truce before all-party talks on British rule in Northern Ireland can begin. \"The president and all of us are working very hard to try to bring about both a ceasefire and then comprehensive and inclusive talks,\" Lake said of the two-year effort led by former Sen. George Mitchell to bring the parties together. \"I hope all of the parties and governments involved, if they look at the alternatives for Northern Ireland, realise that it's time to compromise, time not to get too involved in the details and move forward,\" he said.\n",

      "Violence imperils Israel's plans for tourism surge. Israel's tourism industry hopes to welcome millions of visitors for the country's 50th anniversary in 1998 and the end of the millennium in 2000, but officials fret that political violence could undermine their plans. Tourism officials say they expect celebrations next year will bring a surge of Jewish visitors, followed by a flood of Christians two years later to mark the millennium. \"I expect by the year 2000 we'll see four to five million tourists in Israel,\" said Avi Rosenthal, director of the Israel Hotel Association. That would be nearly double the number Israel hosted in its peak year of 1995. But for now the $3.2 billion tourism sector is experiencing its longest slump in recent years, said Shabtai Shai, the Tourism Ministry's senior deputy director-general. That, in turn, could snag plans to build hotel rooms for the expected but far from assured wave of tourism. With just 40,000 rooms now available, the new rooms are crucial. Tourism officials estimate Israel has about 15,000 rooms in development, of which 10,000 should be ready by 2000. Together with youth hotels, guest houses and other locations, those rooms would give Israel 60,000 rooms for the millennium, Shai estimated -- enough to squeeze in four million visitors. Arrivals reached a record 2.36 million in 1995 but have been falling since early 1996, when a spate of bombings by Islamic militants and an Israeli blitz on Lebanon scared off visitors. In the first half of 1997, incoming tourist arrivals declined six percent to 1.1 million. This summer witnessed the bombing in a Jerusalem open-air market that killed 16 people including the bombers, as well as an attack on British students in Jaffa and the shooting last week of two British hitchhikers, one of whom was killed. \"It's not a major slump, but in recent years we've been used to 12 percent increases,\" said Rosenthal. Israel's hotel industry has taken a big hit. The Tourism Ministry says occupancy rates fell 13.1 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter, the latest for which figures are available, to just 51 percent. An industry source estimated the downturn deepened to 15 percent in July and August. Tourism officials say this summer's incidents alone will not have a long-term impact and tourism should bounce back next year. But continuing violence could threaten a revival. \"People tend to forget. If these are isolated incidents the impact will be minimal,\" said Shai. Rosenthal said tourist arrivals could grow 10 percent next year, putting Israel on track to greet 4.5 million visitors in 2000 -- provided there was no more major violence. Eli Verter, deputy managing director for Africa Israel Hotels and Resorts, was sceptical. \"There is not a lot of optimism,\" he said. \"Around Independence Day (April 30, 1998) there will be a lot of delegations but most of the year will be quiet.\" He said that in the volatile tourism environment it was premature to predict how many tourists would come for the millennium. Rosenthal said: \"I don't see anyone postponing or stopping plans. It's a long-term commitment. On the contrary, Marriott and Four Seasons are in negotiations to get into the country.\" Despite his caution, Verter said Africa Israel planned to add two hotels next year to its chain of eight Holiday Inns and two more in 1999. Shai was less confident about construction. \"There is no question that if there's a decline in arrivals, which is not a one-time decline, there's an impact on investment,\" he said. \"They don't cancel plans but they slow them down.\"\n",

      "Sabotage not seen stopping Thatcher HK bridge gala. An act of sabotage on Hong Kong's showpiece Tsing Ma airport bridge should not stop next weekend's gala opening by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a spokeswoman said on Monday. Cables were cut on the lower deck of the two-tier suspension link and the ceremony should go ahead on the upper deck, spokeswoman Halima Guterres of the government's New Airport Projects Coordination Office said. \"The damage is on the lower deck rather than on the upper deck. At the present moment we believe it would not impact on the opening ceremony,\" she said. Police said on Sunday cables along the emergency tunnel under the road level of the bridge had been cut in 32 places and investigators have classified the case as criminal damage. The world's longest road-rail suspension link, the bridge links Hong Kong proper to the US$20.3 billion Chek Lap Kok airport, built on reclaimed land and due to open in 1998. Thatcher, who signed the 1984 treaty under which Britain will hand the wealthy colony of 6.4 million people to China at midnight June 30, is to declare the bridge open on Sunday. A fireworks display is also planned. Guterres said the damage will soon be repaired. \"The highway department will be going out today to inspect the bridge to check the extent of the damage and rectification measures,\" she said. Police said they were still investigating and were awaiting results of forensic tests.\n",

      "Israel's Netanyahu warned of war danger - UK paper. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to hold urgent talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday after Israeli intelligence warned him of a danger of war with Arab neighbours, a newspaper said on Sunday. In a brief report, Britain's Sunday Times published what it said were extracts from a report by the Shin Bet intelligence agency to Netanyahu on the dangers of continuing with his policy of expanding Jewish settlements. \"Further escalation of the settlements will lead to escalation of violence in the West Bank,\" the report was quoted as saying. \"If we resort to the Thornbush operation (the occupation of Palestinian cities by the Israeli army in the event of violence), the Arab countries will have no other option but to get into a war with us.\" Sunday Times corrrespondent Uzi Mahnaimi did not say how he had obtained a copy of, or extracts from, the top secret report. He said Shin Bet was concerned that Netanyahu had antagonised Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat by publicly accusing him of giving a green light to guerrilla activities by Islamic fundamentalists. \"Mr Arafat is angry and frustrated. He wants a respectable compromise,\" Mahnaimi quoted the report as saying.\n",

      "French stocks end last day of banner year lower. French stocks closed slightly lower on Friday after tracking bonds throughout a quiet session, but the blue chip CAC index advanced 23.71 percent on the year. It closed down 2.90 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,315.73 on Friday after bond futures weakened in late trading on U.S. data showing strong home sales in November. The CAC-40 January futures contract finished 16.5 points lower at 2,311. Volume was 4.8 billion francs, which was thin given that monthly futures and options contracts expired on Friday. Looking ahead, market experts expect the bourse to continue rising next year but at a slower pace. Most analysts, portfolio managers and sales strategists interviewed by Reuters said they expected the CAC index to peak next year at around 2,450 points. The prospect of higher interest rates in the United States and volatility on Wall Street cloud the outlook for the bourse, but market operators say improving French corporate earnings and restructurings of several French industries will lend support. \"Today's session didn't have any great significance. There were too few players,\" one trader said. Activity was muted as the Frankfurt bourse was closed and the London market closed early. Shares in car parts maker Sylea, a major supplier to Fiat, rallied 6.36 percent to 569 francs after the Italian government introduced incentives on Monday to boost car purchases. Sylea generated 38 percent of its 1995 sales with Fiat. Eurotunnel shares fell 2.84 percent to 6.85 francs.

      "UK clarifies Rifkind remarks on Greece-Turkey war. Britain sought on Wednesday to set the record straight over controversial remarks by Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind about the risk of war between Turkey and Greece. The Foreign Office said a number of media reports had incorrectly interpreted Rifkind's comments, in a BBC interview broadcast on Tuesday, as a reference to possible conflict between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus. In fact, the ministry said, Rifkind made his remarks in the specific context of tensions in the Aegean of the sort that almost led to armed conflict last year over revived Turkish claims to the uninhabited Greek islet of Imia. \"His point on Cyprus was a different one. He said there was every reason why there should be a settlement, but that there had been a lack of political will in both Cypriot communities. In his BBC interview, Rifkind said: \"When relations are already bad and tense and difficult and both sides appear to be looking for an excuse to make them worse, that is pretty grim.\" Asked whether there might be conflict between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean, he said: \"It has to be a serious possibility...I am not as confident as logic would imply because there has been a real lack of political will on both sides.\" British officials said they would make sure that governments in the region knew the proper context of Rifkind's remarks, which caused a stir. Greece said the comments were unjust and blamed Ankara for tension in the region, while Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said a war between Turkey and Greece would destabilise the eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. In Wednesday's statement,  the Foreign Office said: \"Britain will remain active and determined in support of the UN's efforts to help the two communities achieve a settlement.\"\n",

      "Saudi visited Egypt to thwart troublemakers - paper. Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia came to Egypt this week to thwart attempts to cause trouble between Saudi and Egyptian leaders, an Egyptian government newspaper said on Thursday. Prince Abdullah arrived in Cairo on Tuesday at short notice and has had two rounds of talks with President Hosni Mubarak. They went to the opera together on Wednesday evening and the prince will leave Egypt later on Thursday, officials said. Well-connected columnist Anis Mansour, writing in the government newspaper al-Ahram, said: \"What happened? What happened is something that has become clear to us here and there -- that they and we both have individuals and groups who are working to cause trouble between the two leaderships,\" he added. \"It is not difficult for these evil people to find land they can plant with mines, nor for them to muddy the waters and fish in them, pollute the atmosphere and hire weak spirits,\" he said. Mansour gave no further explanation of these attempts but a newspaper close to the Saudi government published corruption allegations last week about the two businessmen sons of Mubarak. The sons, Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, denied the allegations, which appeared in the newspaper Asharq al-Awsat, and they have complained to the Egyptian public prosecutor's office. The newspaper could face criminal libel charges. The allegations appeared in an advertisement for the upcoming issue of the newspaper's sister magazine al-Jadida but the publishers withdrew the article at the last moment. The Saudi publishers have since replaced the editor of the magazine, a company source said on Thursday. In a similar case in 1995, Mubarak visited Saudi Arabia to patch up a row over the public flogging in Saudi Arabia of an Egyptian doctor who alleged a Saudi headmaster sexually assaulted his son. The Egyptian press had been severely critical of the way the Saudi authorities treated the doctor. Egyptian state television said Mubarak telephoned King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on Thursday. \"They reviewed the special relations between the two brother countries to bring benefits to the two brotherly peoples,\" it said.\n",

Confidence in better gross domestic product numbers expected for Singapore this year was offset by pre-earnings season jitters, he said.

      "Researcher warns of more Internet security flaws. A major security flaw exists in the Internet's World Wide Web, threatening the privacy of users' passwords, credit card numbers and other secure information, a Princeton University professor says. Edward Felten, of Princeton University's Safe Internet Programming Team, says that surfers can be tricked into surrendering key information to computers \"spoofing\" their favourite sites. The story was originally released in Thurday's Boston Globe. Felten said a malicious Web site can be created that nearly replicates an Internet address and visual interface, thereby mirroring the site a user seeks. There, the unsuspecting user, when prompted, enters private information, which is recorded by the fake site, Felten says. Or, the user might download incorrect or virus-infected information to their computer. The flaw applies to all major Internet browsers, Felten says, including Netscape Communications Corp.'s Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer. Netscape and Microsoft were not immediately available to comment on the report. Felten and his Princeton team in March discovered a security flaw in Sun Microsystems' Java programming language that would have allowed a hacker to booby-trap a Web page and grab control over computers that connected to the site. Sun fixed the bug in the language, which was used in Netscape's Navigator.\n",

A Panorama Marketing Institute poll published in the Israeli daily Maariv found that Israelis are increasingly apprehensive about the future. Only 37 percent believed their country was on the right track, down from 48 percent in a similar poll released four months ago. Thirty-seven percent of the survey's respondents rated Israel's security situation \"good\" or \"very good\", down from 56 percent in July. Only 30 percent felt the Jewish state's world standing was better than in the past, compared to 56 percent in the previous poll. Israel's relations with Arab states have soured since its right-wing government took office in June. Israeli Prime Minister Benajmain Netanyahu's rejection of the \"land-for-peace\" principle underlying five years of Arab-Israeli peace talks has led to an escalation of tensions between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbours.

      "Hundreds remember TWA victims at mass. One year to the day that TWA Flight 800 exploded and crashed into the sea off New York's Long Island, hundreds gathered at a memorial mass for the 230 people who perished in the disaster. Relatives and friends of the victims, colleagues of the flight crew, workers involved in the difficult recovery effort and investigators who have yet to solve the mystery of the crash sat somberly in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. \"When the loss is so sudden and of such magnitude ... the pain we experience is ever more intense,\" said the Rev. John Ferry, the main celebrant at the memorial Mass. \"We come here this morning not to remember how they died, but more importantly to remember how they lived.\" The Roman Catholic Mass was one of at least three memorial services planned in the United States on Thursday for the 230 passengers and crew killed in the July 17, 1996 crash. The victims included citizens of the United States, several European countries and Israel. The Boeing 747 broke up in a fireball without warning just 11 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy international airport on a journey to Paris. A year later, the cause of the disaster remains a mystery. Although investigators know the nearly empty but vapor-filled center fuel tank exploded, they have not determined why. Investigators say they strongly suspect the crash occurred because of a mechanical failure rather than sabotage by bomb or missile, two of the other main theories in the probe. On this first anniversary, U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was frustrated and disappointed that the cause had not been found. \"Of course I'm disappointed that we don't conclusively know. But I'm not sure what else we can do,\" Clinton told reporters at the White House. On Thursday afternoon, New York Gov. George Pataki was scheduled to host a memorial service at Smith Point Park on Long Island near the site where the aircraft fell in thousands of pieces into the Atlantic Ocean. Another service was planned in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, home town of 16 high school French club members and five adult chaperones who died. Lead investigators Robert Francis of the National Transportation Safety Board and FBI assistant director James Kallstrom attended the Mass in New York along with FBI Director Louis Freeh, John Cardinal O'Connor of New York and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Some of those attending the Mass, many of them sympathizers and even tourists who came to pay respects, wiped away tears during the hymns and prayers led by Ferry. In his remarks, Giuliani said he would never forget the moment he heard about the crash of TWA Flight 800 and he praised the families for the love they showed to those they lost in the tragedy. \"I'll never forget the love you displayed and continue to display for each other,\" Giuliani said. \"All of us in New York and America and all around the world have learned many lessons from you.\" Thursday's services and a memorial at the airport on Wednesday for TWA Flight 800's crew were among many events scheduled over five days to remember those who died or to honor the hundreds of people from government agencies or volunteers who worked in the aftermath of the disaster. A highlight of the TWA service was the unveiling of a six-foot high statue featuring three etched glass panels showing the plane taking off, being cupped gently in a pair of hands and then being transformed into a bird.\n",

      "Matsushita feud underlines changing style at Sony. A brouhaha at electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co over whether a member of the founding family should inherit the firm's top post has highlighted a growing contrast in management style with rival Sony Corp . The controversy was sparked by an adviser to the firm, who said last month that vice president Masayuki Matsushita, the son of chairman Masaharu Matsushita, was \"inexperienced and not qualified\" to take over the leadership of what is one of the world's biggest consumer electronics and household appliance groups. Matsushita produces the Panasonic, Technics and Quasar range of electronic goods and is a leading provider of small app, awash with cash and strong technological muscle,\" said Jardine Fleming analyst Masami Fujino. \"Unlike Sony, it works without strong leadership.\" Sony and Matsushita, two of Japan's flagship companies, have pursued contrasting business strategies since 1995, after Matsushita failed in the film and game software business. Matsushita was forced to sell a majority stake in Hollywood film maker MCA Inc in 1995, after a string of disagreements with MCA management, and was nudged out of the videogame market in 1996. Since then it has focused its prowess on hardware manufacturing, particularly of advanced electronics parts such as displays and semiconductors. Sony, on the other hand, is rapidly diversifying into music, films, videogames and broadcasting, while moving away from manufacturing. Analysts agree that Matsushita's most serious problem is the slow pace of change. \"Matsushita, after all, is too large to change quickly,\" said Takanobu Murakami, an analyst at Yamaichi Research Institute. The difference between the two companies is also apparent in their profits and share prices. While Matsushita is clearly recovering from a consumer electronics slump in the early 1990s, forecasting a net group profit of 152 billion yen ($1.31 billion) in the year to March 1998, up six-fold from four years ago, profits are still well below the peak of 259 billion yen ($2.23 billion) in 1990/91. Sony, by contrast, rang up a record group net profit of 139.46 billion yen ($1.20 billion) in 1996/97, becoming a darling of investors in the stock market. Sony's share price hit a record high of 12,600 yen on August 1. On that same day, Matsushita's shares traded up to 2,520 yen, their highest in nearly eight years, but were still well below their 1988 record of 3,070 yen. On Tuesday, Sony shares closed at 11,600 yen, up 200 yen, while Matsushita closed at 2,380 yen, up 20 yen. ($1=116 yen)\n",

The U.S. Defence Department said nearly all the classified documents recording incidents of chemical weapons use during the Gulf war are missing despite an exhaustive search, the New York Times reported on Friday. The paper said copies of the logs were kept in safes at two U.S. locations, but a new report from the Defence Department indicates only 36 pages out of an estimated 200 have been found in a search by its investigators. The missing logs include those for eight days in March 1991 when U.S. troops unknowingly blew up chemical weapons in an Iraqi arms dump, the paper said. Those logs, which were maintained for Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, were first reported missing in December. Friday's paper said the new report heightens speculation about a cover-up or criminal incompetence within the Defence Department, which had denied the existence of such records before agreeing last year to release them to a veterans' group. It said the logs were recorded on floppy disks and on paper and shipped to the headquarters of the United States Central Command in Tampa, Florida. A separate computer disk containing the information was stored at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, but nearly all the information at both sites has vanished, the Times said.

A bomb on Tuesday obliterated Moscow's only monument to Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, a 10-metre (30-foot) bronze statue only erected last year. \"A preliminary investigation has proved that the explosion was carried out in a very professional way. Practically nothing is left from the monument,\" said a spokesman for the Moscow office of the Federal Security Service (FSB). \"It was a senseless act of vandalism,\" Itar-Tass news agency quoted Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as saying. \"One can have differing views of the last Russian emperor, but this senseless, barbaric act cannot strike out pages of our country's history.\" Neighbours told Reuters a loud explosion at about 6.30 a.m. blew the statue to pieces. The statue, showing Nicholas wearing a crown and regalia, was erected last yar in a remote spot in northeast Moscow that reflected official uncertainty towards the tsar. Police at first thought the report might be an April Fool joke. \"I did not believe it at first since it is April 1 today,\" said Mikhail Smorodsky, the district police chief. Curious onlookers walked by the site littered with bronze fragments and children took little pieces as souvenirs. Nicholas abdicated 80 years ago last month, a move that paved the way for the Bolsheviks to take power. Public interest in the monarchy has grown since communism's collapse, and the resurgent Orthodox Church is considering making him a saint. A spokeswoman for the All-Russia Monarchist Centre said the act could be related to the current visit to the capital of one of the royal family's descendants. \"I am sure this has a political background, especially now when Grand Duchess Leonida Georgiyevna is paying a private visit in Moscow,\" the spokeswoman said.\n",

      "Cows' marathon march ends, breeders see Chirac. Breeders who led a herd of cows on a marathon march to Paris won a pledge from President Jacques Chirac on Friday that he would help save their livelihoods jeopardised by the mad cow crisis. While the 26 cows rested in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower after covering some 350 kms (220 miles) in three weeks, the head of state spent almost an hour and a half hearing the grievances of five breeders who praised his \"farmers' language\". \"The president told us that he wouldn't let us down but he had no magic wand,\" Pierre Grolleau, 53, told reporters. \"For the outcome, we'll see tomorrow. We're people who are not in a hurry,\" he added. \"We told him we were losing 3,000 francs ($600) per animal and he said he couldn't compensate for all the losses because of the Budget Ministry,\" said Nathalie Telemaque, 29, complaining of prices that slumped because of this year's disclosure that mad cow disease appeared to be a risk to human health. Shortly after the meeting, national statistics institute INSEE said prices for beef cattle fell another 10.2 percent in July, and were down 19 percent compared to year-earlier levels. Chirac, a conservative popular with farmers since he started out as an agriculture minister lobbying for them in Brussels, struck a charismatic note with the breeders. \"He talks like a farmer. We laughed a bit, we interrupted each other,\" Grolleau said. But the protesters from the central town of Charroux won no specific commitments or a timetable for reforms. \"He spoke of reducing overheads rather than grants. He said he would safeguard cattle-breeding on a family basis,\" Telemaque said. Chirac also discussed creating a new logo to better identify the origin of meat imports following a show of force by thousands of farmers who blockaded roads across the country before dawn on Thursday to carry out spot checks on lorries. Prime Minister Alain Juppe said later he had given Agriculture Minister Philippe Vasseur orders to be \"especially pugnacious\" in seeking greater European Union aid for farmers hit by the mad cow crisis. The cows did not follow their masters into the Elysee courtyard. \"It's pretty difficult to manage stock here, even though we do have stables,\" quipped one Elysee aide. Wearing jeans and sweatshirts with rolled-up sleeves, the herders were also stripped of their staffs before entering Chirac's gilded offices. Some 1,500 breeders from various regions demonstrated on the grassy Champs de Mars park near the Eiffel Tower, joining the small group of Charroux breeders. On Thursday, about 15,000 farmers blockaded roads across France, checking trucks in a protest aimed at barring imports of beef from outside the EU because of low prices caused by the mad cow crisis. Thursday's blockades were the first in a wave of social unrest expected to target the austerity-minded government in coming weeks. European beef sales plunged after Britain announced the discovery of a likely link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, and its fatal human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).\n",

      "Bosnia is Europe's problem after 18 months -Cohen. The United States has no intention of keeping troops in Bosnia beyond mid-1998 even if European nations decide further peacekeeping is needed, U.S. Defence Secretary nominee William Cohen said on Wednesday. \"We are not going to be there...this is the kind of issue that can go on too long,\" Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee at his confirmation hearing. \"It (Bosnia) was principally a European problem to be solved...it is time for them to assume responsibility,\" he said in response to questions. The United States is participating with 8,500 troops in a new, second round of a NATO-led peacekeeping in Bosnia which is scheduled to end in 18 months. \"That (18 months) would be the parameter...a signal and a very strong message to our European friends. We are not going to be there. This is going to end at this point,\" Cohen, a former Republican senator from Maine, said as he breezed through the hearing with praise from Democrats and Republicans. Cohen said the United States would examine its troop commitment in Bosnia every six months and he expected the U.S. contribution to come down significantly within a year and \"that we would be out at the end of that 18 months.\" \"That is something that I intend to convey to our European allies,\" Cohen said. \"One of the first things I would hope to do if confirmed is to make a trip to visit with our European friends and to indicate the strong feelings that we have about it.\"\n",

      "Turkish government approves Islamist crackdown. Turkey's Islamist-led government said on Thursday it would rigorously implement a crackdown on religious activism demanded by the secularist military. \"The (army's) decisions will be sincerely enforced,\" Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told reporters after a cabinet meeting. Istanbul stocks soared on hopes of government stability. Orders from the military-dominated National Security Council (MGK) to carry out a list of anti-Islamist demands had caused friction in Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's ruling alliance. \"The prime minister and I both gave clear orders to the relevant ministries to implement the MGK decisions in the short term, medium term and long term,\" said Ciller, head of the coalition's pro-Western wing. \"Our government is committed against the reactionary danger,\" said cabinet spokesman Lutfu Esengun, from Erbakan's Welfare Party (RP). Neither gave details of specific action the government would take. Political analysts say Erbakan should have little difficulty in giving concessions to the army on issues he does not see as directly affecting his grassroots support, like getting tough on religious extremists. But he will have problems consenting to the generals' demands that the coalition legislate against peaceful Islamist dissent and restrict the number of religious secondary schools, known as \"Imam Hatips\". Many supporters of the Welfare Party and some of Erbakan's ministers were educated at religious shcools. Ciller's True Path Party (DYP) has also encouraged religious education. \"Any compromise that ends with the closure of Imam Hatips and the abuse of human rights and freedoms will be a decree of death for the DYP and RP,\" columnist Fehmi Koru wrote in the Zaman daily, a moderate Islamist paper that often criticises Erbakan. Welfare had upset the army in recent months with plans to increase the role of Islam in public life. The generals replied with orders for a return to the rigid secularism of the 1920s, when republican Turkey was rising from the ashes of the religion-based Ottoman Empire. Other army demands include enforcing a ban on Islamic dress and halting the recent growth in Islamic brotherhoods, known as \"tarikats\". The military row has led to speculation that the military would staged its fourth coup since 1960 and has distracted from Erbakan's initial success in an ambitious privatisation programme. The Istanbul stock market's general index closed 67 points, or 4.66 percent, higher at 1,504. \"There was an overall buying activity on positive news about the cabinet meeting,\" said Serdar Karatepe from Polen securities. Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, came to power last year after narrowly winning 1995 elections with 21 percent of the vote. The secularist majority complain he has no mandate to change the country's system.\n",

      "Ex-Philippine rebel leader vows to help farmers. Former Moslem rebel leader Nur Misuari, who last year traded his guns for peace in the southern Philippines, on Tuesday vowed to help coconut farmers increase productivity. \"At one time you were under the influence of people who did nothing but exploit you, stole the little that you had. Now we intend to rectify all of this,\" Misuari told an audience of farmers. He said improving the lot of coconut farmers was a priority because they comprised a large section of the population of southern Mindanao where Misuari waged a guerrilla war for more than 20 years. Last year, his Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) agreed to a peace deal with the government under which Misuari was appointed chairman of an interim body called the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development. The council is the forerunner to an autonomous region in the southern Philippines. Clad in a business suit and sitting at a table with a host of farmers and government officials, Misuari said farmers needed to lobby the government for their needs. \"Farmers, if you want to fight for your rights you need to have someone to speak on your behalf against the mighty power in our society,\" Misuari said referring to a widely held belief that politics and high government posts in the country were the preserve of a few elite families. Misuari said since the signing the peace pact, several foreign investors had expressed interest in investing in Mindanao, believed to be the Philippines' richest region in mineral and natural gas resources.\n",

      "Malaysia NGOs want public forum on police abuse. Malaysian human rights groups involved in a controversy over a planned forum on police abuse said on Wednesday they had a right to hold the meeting despite government objections. A joint statement by 11 Malaysian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) said the \"Tribunal Rakyat\" (\"People's Tribunal\") forum would be \"based on actual experiences and outcome of abuse of police powers\". Malaysian police challenged the accusations. The federal police headquarters said in a statement on Wednesday that it always treated allegations of criminal misconduct by its members with \"care and sensitivity\", the national Bernama news agency reported. Senior police and government officials have said the forum could undermine national security, but the NGOs disputed this, saying it could improve professionalism in the force. The forum was originally planned for December 15 but had to be postponed when Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob said the organisers did not have a police permit -- a requirement in Malaysia for any public gathering. Megat Junid had warned that if the meeting went ahead without the permit, participants could be arrested under the Internal Security Act, which allows for detention of up to two years without trial. \"Surely such a tribunal cannot pose a threat to national security; on the contrary, it is a valuable feedback mechanism to improve the level of professional service of the police force,\" said the NGOs' statement, faxed to news organisations. The NGOs also disputed suggestions the forum was prompted by foreigners wanting to paint a bad picture of Malaysia. \"The tribunal is a wholly and truly Malaysian affair, organised and participated by Malaysians for Malaysians,\" the statement said.\n",

      "Burundi nearly free of Rwandan Hutu refugees. Aid officials said they expected the last Rwandan refugees in Burundi who want to go home voluntarily to do so on Tuesday, ending the biggest repatriation since two million fled two years ago. The officials said they had sent more than 100 trucks to move some 6,000 Rwandans from Rukuramigabo camp in Burundi to a transit centre near the southwestern Rwandan town of Butare. \"We have sent down a trucking capacity for over 7,000 people. It's more than 100 trucks,\" said Simona Opitz, a spokeswoman for International Organisation for Migration (IOM). \"We hope to get everyone out from Rukuramigabo today. Most returnees will pass through Musange transit camp before returning to their home communes,\" she added in the Rwandan capital. Officials of the U.N. refugee agency said they would find out on Tuesday whether any of the last 6,000 refugees at the last Rwandan camp in Burundi refused to go home voluntarily. The biggest Rwandan refugee camp in Burundi was emptied on Thursday except for 223 Hutus who said they did not want to go back to their homeland and were allowed by Burundian authorities to stay. They say they fear arrest or attack if they return home. There were more than 130,000 Rwandan refugees in Burundi at the start of the year. The Hutu refugees leaving Burundi are part of more than two million who fled Rwanda in 1994 during civil war and in fear of reprisal attacks for the genocidal killing of up to one million Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs. Refugees began returning in large numbers after Pierre Buyoya and Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army seized power on July 25. They have accused troops of harassing them and three were killed by Burundian soldiers on August 18. Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said last week Zaire and Rwanda had agreed an \"organised, massive and unconditional\" repatriation of 1.1 million Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire. He said the repatriation would be \"enormous and immediate\" and Zaire would close all Rwandan refugee camps on its soil. UNHCR was not consulted in advance about the Zairean-Rwandan agreement, which prompted a Rwandan Hutu refugee lobby group to warn expulsions of refugees from Zaire could start within days. The international community has spent millions of dollars in aid on refugees in Burundi amid constant fears of their being dragged into conflict between Burundian Hutu rebels and the army. The U.N. World Food Programme said on Monday four trucks carrying high protein biscuits, medicine and rice for displaced and refugees in Burundi arrived on Sunday after regional states exempted them from nearly month-old sanctions on the country. Rwandan authorities screen returning refugees and arrest any suspected of involvement in genocide. There are nearly 80,000 prisoners and detainees held in prisons and lockups in Rwanda.\n",

      "Lesotho court rejects mutineers' indemnity plea. Lesotho's high court on Tuesday dismissed an application by eight rebel policemen who seized control of police headquarters last week to have murder charges against them dropped. Judge Michael Ramolibeli dismissed the case in which the eight officers argued they were entitled to indemnity in terms of the 1996 Pardons Act. The Act stipulates that security force members in this tiny and mountainous Southern African kingdom may not be charged for any crimes committed from 1993 to 1995. The policemen, all from the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police, are suspected of allegedly murdering three colleagues at the Maseru charge office in October 1995. A meeting of high-ranking officers on Monday resolved to form a committee to negotiate an end to the dispute. It also ordered Police Commissioner Major General Bolutu Makoaba, ousted from his post by the rebels during his absence, back to work.\n",

We can improve the classifier by allowing it to apply multiple labels to the articles as labels aren't mutually exclusive with others."
